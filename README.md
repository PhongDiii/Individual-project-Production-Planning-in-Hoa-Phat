Analyze and propose the plan to monitor and estimate business aspects 
# Overview
Production Planning is one of the extremely important aspects in the field of Logistics and Supply Chain Management. In this article, I used the case of Hoa Phat Steel Group Corporation (Hoa Phat) is one of Vietnam's leading steel producers. The company has a strong presence in the domestic market and is also a major exporter of steel products. 
To achieve these ambitious targets, I am implementing a comprehensive production planning process. This process includes the following steps:
* Demand forecasting: I forecasts demand for its steel products based on a variety of factors, including economic growth, construction activity, and global steel prices.
* Production planning: Based on the demand forecast, I develops a production plan that optimizes the use of its raw materials and production capacity.
* Inventory management: I maintains an optimal level of inventory to ensure that it can meet customer demand while minimizing carrying costs.
* Supply chain management: I develop the supply chain network by using algorithms
* Production scheduling: I schedules its production activities to ensure that it can meet customer deadlines and minimize downtime.
Production planning process is a key factor in the company's success. The process helps me to appoach realistic problems to produce high-quality steel products at a competitive price. This has made the company  a leading player in the global steel market.
